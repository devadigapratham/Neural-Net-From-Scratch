# Neural Network for Synthetic Spiral Data Classification

This project demonstrates the training and evaluation of a neural network for classifying synthetic spiral data into multiple classes. It includes code for data generation, model architecture, training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Files

The project is organized into the following files:

1. `generate_spiral_data.py`: Generates synthetic spiral data and saves it to a file.
2. `load_data.py`: Loads synthetic spiral data from a file.
3. `neural_network.py`: Defines the neural network components, including layers, activations, loss functions, and optimizers.
4. `evaluate_model.py`: Evaluates the trained neural network model on test data.
5. `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: Performs hyperparameter tuning using a grid search approach.
6. `visualize_data.py`: Contains functions for visualizing the synthetic spiral data and decision boundaries.
7. `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire project, including data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
